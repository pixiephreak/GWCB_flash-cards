// ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the cloze-deleted portion of the text.
// ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the partial text.
// ClozeCard should have a property or method that contains or returns only the full text.
// ClozeCard should throw or log an error when the cloze deletion does not appear in the input text.
// Use prototypes to attach these methods, wherever possible.
// As your application will not have a front end, your only need to determine an efficient way to store cloze-deleted cardsâ€”you don't have to solve the problem of displaying them. You are free to decide how you'd like to implement this. One might represent the above flashcard thus:
// The bulk of this assignment is implementing ClozeCard. If you build a robust ClozeCard implementation, feel free to try your hand at implementing a front-end, as well.
